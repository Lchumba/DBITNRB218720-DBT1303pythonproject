print(" your "  + code + " is Noted, Thank You")

Visit_House_number = input("enter the house mapped to the code above")
print(" your " + Visit_House_number + "has been mapped to "+ code )

#On the day of the visit the Host shares the code with the expected guest privately

'''Security asks the visitor for details'''
